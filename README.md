# Data-and-Access-control

The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) states that users, applications, and systems should have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or breaches. By enforcing PoLP, organizations enhance security and limit potential damage from insider threats or compromised accounts.
